PROBLEM STATEMENT 1

The number of crimes being reported has been increasing day by day. People are
    often in a state of panic and confusion during an emergency and are unable to
    properly report the crime to the relevant authorities. This leads to a delay in
    response time and can result in further harm being done. To tackle this issue, we
    challenge you to build a chat-bot that can help individuals quickly and efficiently
    report crimes to the respective authorities and suggest preventive measures for
    emergency scenarios.

The chat-bot should be user-friendly and able to gather relevant information from
    the individual reporting the crime, such as the type of crime, location, and any other
    relevant details. It should also be able to provide immediate assistance by
    suggesting preventive measures and connecting the individual to the relevant
    authorities. The chat-bot should be accessible through multiple platforms, such as
    websites, mobile applications, and social media, to ensure widespread availability
    and accessibility.

It should be designed in such a way that it ensures the privacy and confidentiality of
    the individual reporting the crime. The chat-bot should also be able to handle
    multiple languages to cater to a larger audience.
    We believe that such a chat-bot has the potential to revolutionize the way crimes
    are reported and can help reduce response time, improve safety, and increase
    efficiency in emergency situations. So, join us in this challenge and build a chat-bot
    that can make a real impact!
