PROBLEM STATEMENT 1



 1. Name of your App.
ANS :- API(Assistant Police Inspector)
------------------------------------------------
2. What is the problem statement?
ANS :-

 The increasing number of reported crimes has led to delays in response time, causing further harm due to individuals being unable to properly report the crime in a state of panic and confusion during an emergency. To address this issue, we challenge you to build a chat-bot that is user-friendly and can gather relevant information such as the type of crime and location, provide immediate assistance, suggest preventive measures, and connect the individual to the relevant authorities. The chat-bot should be accessible through multiple platforms, ensure privacy and confidentiality, and support multiple languages. We believe this can revolutionize the way crimes are reported and improve emergency response time, safety, and efficiency. Join us and make a real impact!

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How does this solve it?
ANS :-

Postman is a powerful tool for designing, testing, and documenting APIs. To build a chat-bot that can quickly and efficiently report crimes to relevant authorities, we use Postman to create an API that can gather information such as the type of crime, location, and any other relevant details from the individual reporting the crime.

The chat-bot API can then provide immediate assistance by suggesting preventive measures and connecting the individual to the relevant authorities. With the help of Postman, We design the API to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the individual reporting the crime.

We also use Postman to test the API to ensure it functions as intended and document it to ensure widespread availability. Overall, using Postman to create an API can be an effective solution to building a chat-bot that can make a real impact in addressing the increasing number of reported crimes and improving emergency response time, safety, and efficiency.


4. How is it unique from other solutions?
ANS :-

Compared to other solutions for reporting crimes, a chat-bot that uses an API built with Postman can be unique in several ways. First, the use of an API allows for more efficient and accurate data gathering from the individual reporting the crime. This can help ensure that relevant details are properly documented and transmitted to the relevant authorities in a timely manner, improving response time and reducing further harm.

Second, the ability to suggest preventive measures through the chat-bot can be a unique feature that sets it apart from other solutions. By providing immediate assistance and guiding the individual on how to protect themselves and prevent further harm, the chat-bot can make a real impact in emergency scenarios.

Finally, the use of Postman to create the chat-bot API can ensure privacy and confidentiality of the individual reporting the crime. These features can make the chat-bot unique from other solutions and make it more effective in addressing the increasing number of reported crimes.
